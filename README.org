#+title: visual-shorthands - Purely visual prefix abbreviations

Visual-shorthands provides display-only abbreviations for long symbol prefixes
using overlays. Unlike Emacs' [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Shorthands.html][built-in]] ~read-symbol-shorthands~, which requires
file-local variables and affects eval, visual-shorthands operates purely at the
display layer and can be toggled interactively.

The package is designed for /reading/ code written by others with verbose naming
conventions, such as Emacs Lisp code and packages, but it can still be used in
other languages like Lisps, python, etc. If you need actual Namespaces, use the
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Shorthands.html][built-in shorthands]]. Symbols are automatically revealed when the cursor enters
them, allowing normal navigation and editing of the actual buffer text.

Also using [[https://github.com/gggion/lisp-docstring-toggle][lisp-docstring-toggle]] to hide docstrings in the buffer for readability's sake.
